## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and findings of the project "Impact Analysis of Contention on Multi-Core Platforms for Real-Time Critical Applications and Machine Learning." The project investigates the effects of hardware contention on the performance of machine learning (ML) applications running on multicore platforms. The study focuses on mixed-criticality systems (MCS) and explores techniques to mitigate the impact of contention using the Bao hypervisor.
